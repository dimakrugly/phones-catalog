# Phone-Catalogue
Phone catalog web app showcasing React, Redux, TypeScript, and responsive design

[DEMO LINK](https://dimakrugly.github.io/react_phone-catalog/)

# About
This GitHub portfolio project demonstrates my expertise in frontend development, particularly in creating a detailed web application for browsing phone catalogs. By utilizing technologies such as React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript, I've developed a strong and intuitive platform for exploring the newest smartphones. The integration of local storage enhances personalized user interactions, while functional components streamline code structure and upkeep.

# Features
* React, Redux, and TypeScript: Merge React's declarative approach seamlessly with Redux's state management capabilities, while taking advantage of TypeScript's type safety and improved development workflow.

* Redux Toolkit: Employ Redux Toolkit to simplify the complexity of Redux logic, speeding up development and enhancing code maintainability.

* Local Storage Integration: Empower users to save their preferred phones locally, guaranteeing a personalized experience that persists betwe*en sessions.

* Functional Components: Embrace React's functional components for concise and reusable UI elements, improving code clarity and maintainability.

* API Data Fetching: Dynamically retrieve phone data from external APIs to furnish users with the most recent listings, ensuring the catalog stays current with real-time updates.

* Adaptive Layout Design: Implement responsive design principles to deliver an optimal user experience and visual appeal across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
